# Find Your Item
This project is a React web app made to view available items and add them or remove them from your favorites list. It connects to a personal API coded with Rail to get the User info as well as the Items and the Favorites List for each User.
Built according to [Microverse's requirements](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Find-Your-House-9a424802e7dc48eb8ef40e2ac09397d1).
All the information is saved in the BackEnd API.
